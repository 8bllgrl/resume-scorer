Strong analytical mindset with exposure to data analytics and mathematical concepts
In-depth understanding of AFL and NRL sports rules to deliver accurate, domain-specific solutions would be advantageous

Now is the time to join Tabcorp! The start of a new, exciting chapter in our long history. We have a dynamic, new CEO in Gillon McLachlan and we’re building a winning culture by bringing our office-based teams together onsite every day. We value flexibility - like adjusting start or finish times however we believe being together is key to our success.

We’re committed to creating an inclusive workplace where everyone feels valued for their contribution and has a sense of belonging and is treated with respect. As a Tabcorp employee, you will:

foster a respectful and inclusive working environment within your team;
support and contribute to initiatives aimed at managing the risk of gender inequality, sexual harassment and other inappropriate behaviour in our workplaces.
